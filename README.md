# Hypercomm::Aggregation Library

## Introduction
This is the aggregation/aggregator component of the Hypercomm suite of libraries for Charm++. It supports virtual routing, and chare-arrays, chare-groups, and chare-node-groups.

## Usage
To use the library, declare an `initproc` calling `aggregation::initialize` within your `.ci` file:

```cpp
namespace aggregation {
	initproc void initialize(void);
}
 ```
 
 Then, include `hypercomm/aggregation.hpp` within your C++ code.

We recommend using a `std::unique_ptr` to hold your aggregator, declaring it as such:


```cpp
std::unique_ptr<aggregator_t> aggregator;
...
aggregator = std::unique_ptr<aggregator_t>(new aggregator_t(
	/* message threshold, e.g. 100 */,
	/* flush timeout, e.g. 0.1s */,
	[this](void*  msg) { /* endpoint functionality */ },
	/* node level, true/false */
	/* ccd periodic condition, e.g. 10ms, idle, etc. */));
);
```

Send calls should go through the aggregator itself, e.g.:
	
```cpp
aggregator.send(idx, ...);
proxy->ckLocalBranch()->aggregator->send(idx, ...);
```

In node-level scenarios, the aggregator is thread-safe and does not need an external lock ðŸ˜Š
